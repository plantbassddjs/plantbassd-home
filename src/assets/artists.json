He’s earned releases on the @dense_and_pika imprint @kneadedpains and dropped his ‘Fugazi’ EP on @autektone last August, and has another release with the former on the horizon.\\n\\nIt’s a very exciting path for Monaghan’s first real techno act and one of the country’s most promising. He’s had his numbers played out by the likes of @charlottedewittemusic, @michael_bibi_ , @saralandrydj and more. We’re very excited to share his unique, raw industrial sound with you all.\\n\\nLink to playlist in bio\\n\\nThanks to @eggboy_design for the graphics 🤝",
